# Plot_Raster
This script contains MATLAB codes to perform relationship estimation between two variables where the data are in raster format. This script estimated the relationship between climate variables and phenology parameters. For example, the relationship between precipitation and the length of season, elevation and the length of season, and precipitation and the small integral.

The script given here is a part of one of the academic projects at Lund University. I wrote this code for statistical analysis. However, there were three members in this project (Myself, Maja Holm, and Maja KÃ¤llehult) who jointly performed the other tasks of the project, i.e., phenology estimation, data processing, report writing. 

The original project dealt with the phenology parameters of vegetation in the eastern Sahel region. The phenology variables were estimated using the TIMESAT application from MODIS images. You can learn more about TIMESAT here: https://web.nateko.lu.se/timesat/timesat.asp. We also used TerrSet and ArcGIS Pro to process raster and vector data in this project.

This script contains code for processing raster data in MATLAB, including extracting pixel values, converting a matrix to a vector, merging columns into the table, data cleaning, splitting the table into columns, and creating scatter plots.

If you want to read our entire project's findings, read the "Time_Series_Report_Group_6" file.

Here are some figures generated by this MATLAB script:
